# Hand-Digit-Recognizer-Python
This project is designed to recognize the number of fingers displayed by a hand using a webcam. It leverages OpenCV for webcam handling and Mediapipe for hand detection. The application captures hand gestures, processes them, and dynamically displays the number of fingers raised in real-time.
